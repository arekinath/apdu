%% @doc An apdu_transform implementation which handles ISO7816 command
%%      and response chaining.
%%
%% With this transformation enabled, you can send long APDUs using a single
%% <code>iso7816:apdu_cmd()</code> record containing all of the concatenated
%% data. The transformation will handle breaking it up into a series of
%% chained smaller APDUs.
%%
%% When a card replies with the <code>61XX</code> "continue" response code,
%% this transformation will also take over and issue <code>GET_RESPONSE</code>
%% commands as needed until the full length has been read, giving you a single
%% {@link apdu:reply()} record containing all of the data and the
%% final status word.
